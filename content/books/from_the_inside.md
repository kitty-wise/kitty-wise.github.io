Ten tales of trans lesbian goodness. These stories cover a variety of topics and styles, at times funny, at other times emotional and intimate. With plenty of spice to go around.

Content warnings: *anal training, bathroom control, chem play, consensual non-consent, corruption, demons, dollification, eldritch horrors, overcoming dysphoria, oviposition, petplay, sacrilege, tentacle sex, and violent consensual sex*.

**The Best Dog In the Universe** - As the last human in the universe, she has one job: to be the best puppygirl she can be. And if that includes breeding with aliens? All the better.

**Ex Inferis** - Why do the usual and summon a succubus for some fun times, when you can summon a baphomet instead? They’re spicy to the touch and taste.

**The Professor** - Pining for that brilliant professor she can't stop thinking about. First thing's first, she's got to dial back that libido by fucking around a bit.

**The Lady Of The House** - When the investigator first discovers a house full of obedient women, she knew it must be a cult. Only, she can't seem to find the will to leave. And why does it feel so good to obey?

**Doing My Part For The Pack** - Humans have damaged other lifeforms for far too long, and it's time to give back. The best way to make reparations is to help those other lifeforms repopulate.

**From The Inside** - Feeling dysphoria during sex is never a good time, but through love and patience, a couple can find a way through.

**Cat Got Her Tongue** - Any mistress worth her salt knows how to take care of her catgirl, and a good catgirl knows how to be a submissive kitten.

**Thorns In Her Side** - A journey through religious thought as a stranger corrupts the mind of a monk, until the monk learns a deep secret about herself.

**By Ancient Hands** - Feeling left behind, a girl finds the perfect top to train her for anal play. What she then realises is far darker than she expected.

**To Heal The Mind** - A woman at her wit's end finds a special connection with a psychiatrist, who is all too happy to show her the depths of what is possible with total obedience.
