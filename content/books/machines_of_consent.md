**_Longlisted for [Best Transfeminine Fiction of 2025](https://thetransfemininereview.com/2025/12/07/2025-longlist-best-fiction/)!_**

Dr. Jess Stockton is a scientist with high goals and even higher ambitions. Through her efforts, she has created a device based around consent which has revolutionised society and drawn no small amount of attention both good and bad.

Roh is a freerunning messenger for the underground with the solitary goal of survival. When tested in the lab for the consent device, she displays a very odd set of biometrics which should be impossible in humans.

Machines of Consent follows two trans lesbians in a sci-fi adventure as they find each other and try to escape an oppressive force bent to use them for nefarious ends. Both cyberpunk and spicy blockbuster, it’s a thrill ride from start to finish.

Do you consent to the heat?
