<p>Transistance Press is a project born of passion and resistance. Trans art and creative expression is under attack, and we aim to fight back.</p>

<p>Our goal is to uplift trans creativity and preserve open access to our literature.</p>

<p>So much of the infrastructure indie trans authors rely on is based in the United States, and subject to US laws. One of the goals explicitly laid out in Project 2025, a conservative manifesto that is now influencing the incoming US Government, is to criminalise trans literature. Even legislation that is currently being debated, like the Kids Online Safety Act, threatens queer and trans speech online, and could impact many of the tools and platforms trans and queer writers use to sell and market their works.</p>

<p>Bethany Karsten of The Transfeminine Review recently posted a <a href="https://thetransfemininereview.com/2024/11/13/a-practical-guide-to-resisting-censorship/">frightening article</a> detailing what’s at risk for our community going into the next four years (we’d also strongly encourage you to read her article and learn what you can do to help preserve trans literature for future generations). The platforms we use to create, store, sell, read, share, and discuss trans and queer literature are almost all based in the United States, and could very soon be at risk from forces in power that want to silence us. Because US-based services are so heavily relied upon by indie authors, queer book lovers, and the queer and trans community more broadly, this poses an existential threat not just in the United States, but worldwide.</p>

<p>As Oceanians, we believe we’re in a position to act. Transistance’s work is entirely based in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand, allowing us to host our servers locally, and build community and infrastructure to help globalise and protect the development, distribution, and discussion of trans literature.</p>

<p><p>A key piece of ensuring our community around the world stays safe is our focus on security across all aspects of our operations. For example, all Transistance Press official communications is handled using secure email or Signal.</p>

We understand that most of the trans literary scene is made up of indie authors, and we recognise the importance of writers maintaining control over their work. Our vision is to support the work of trans authors and promote it to the world, without restricting our voices.

<p>Likewise, we also want our readers to have a better experience engaging with trans literature. That’s why we’re committed to Transistance’s Ebooks being available DRM free – so you’re not buying a license to access our content.</p>

<p>Also: fuck AI.</p>

<p>Trans art is unique. Trans art is powerful. Trans art is human. Trans art is an act of resistance.</p>

<p>We’re here to ensure trans art thrives.</p>
